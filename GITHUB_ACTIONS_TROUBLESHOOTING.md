# GitHub Actions APK Build Troubleshooting

## The Issue You Experienced

The workflow failed due to **deprecated GitHub Actions**. Here's what was wrong and how it's now fixed:

### Problems Fixed:
1. ✅ Updated `actions/upload-artifact@v3` → `v4`
2. ✅ Updated all actions to latest versions
3. ✅ Simplified the workflow to be more reliable
4. ✅ Added proper error handling
5. ✅ Used JDK 17 instead of 11 (better compatibility)

## New Simplified Workflow

The updated workflow (`build-apk.yml`) now:
- Uses only supported, non-deprecated actions
- Has better error handling
- Creates gradlew wrapper if missing
- Uploads APK artifacts that last 30 days
- Creates GitHub releases automatically

## Testing Your Setup

**Run this first to test basic setup:**
```
Actions → "Test Basic Build" → "Run workflow"
```

This will verify:
- Node.js setup works
- npm install works
- Project structure is correct
- Capacitor configuration is valid

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Commit the fixed workflow:**
```bash
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "fix: Update GitHub Actions workflow with non-deprecated actions"
git push origin master
```

2. **Test the workflow:**
- Go to GitHub → Actions tab
- Click "Test Basic Build" → "Run workflow"
- If that works, try "Build Android APK"

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "npm ci" fails
**Solution:** The workflow now uses `npm ci || npm install` as fallback

### Issue: "gradlew not found"
**Solution:** The workflow now creates gradlew wrapper automatically

### Issue: "APK not found"
**Solution:** The workflow now searches for APK files and shows their location

### Issue: "Permissions denied"
**Solution:** Added proper permissions to the workflow

## What You'll Get

When the workflow succeeds:
1. **Artifact:** APK available in Actions tab for 30 days
2. **Release:** Automatic GitHub release with downloadable APK
3. **Clear instructions:** Download and install instructions included

## If It Still Fails

1. **Check the logs:** Click on the failed workflow run to see detailed logs
2. **Run test workflow first:** Use "Test Basic Build" to isolate issues
3. **Manual trigger:** Use "Run workflow" button instead of push trigger
4. **Check repository settings:** Ensure Actions are enabled

The workflow is now much more robust and should handle most common issues automatically.
