## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality

## üîç Troubleshooting Workflows

If the main build has issues, try these diagnostic workflows:

### 1. Enhanced Debug Build
```
Actions ‚Üí "Build Debug APK (Enhanced)" ‚Üí Run workflow
```
- Adds extra verification steps
- Shows actual package ID in APK
- Detailed build analysis

### 2. Troubleshoot Build
```
Actions ‚Üí "Troubleshoot APK Build" ‚Üí Run workflow
```
- Minimal configuration
- WebView debugging enabled
- 10-second timeout detection
- Shows console errors

## üìä Expected Results

### Successful Fixed Build:
- **Size:** 4-6MB
- **Package:** 
  - Debug: `com.elderwise.app.debug`
  - Release: `com.elderwise.app`
- **Load time:** 2-5 seconds
- **No hanging or white screen**

### What's Different:
1. **No PWA conflicts** - Service worker removed
2. **Correct paths** - All paths are relative
3. **Clean build** - Fresh Android project each time
4. **Proper package IDs** - Debug and release separated

## üö® If It Still Doesn't Work

1. **Check WebView version:**
   - Update Android System WebView from Play Store
   - Minimum version: 80+

2. **Enable debugging:**
   - Connect device to computer
   - Open Chrome ‚Üí chrome://inspect
   - Look for ElderWise under Remote Target
   - Check console for errors

3. **Try troubleshoot build:**
   - Use the diagnostic workflow
   - It has timeout detection
   - Shows specific error messages

## üìù Report Results

After testing, note:
1. Which workflow you used
2. Build type (debug/release)
3. Whether it loaded successfully
4. Any error messages
5. Time to load (approximately)

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

Your APK is working correctly if:
- Installs without package conflicts
- Loads within 5 seconds
- Shows ElderWise UI (not blank)
- Camera features work
- No crashes or hangs
